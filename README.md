This repository holds ideas and experiments for the turbo Subgroup Discovery
project. Here are the folders:

-  code: Java code. Currently, there is an implementation of classic Beam
   Search. It is is not useful as such, but the idea was to get a "feel" for the
   algorithm. Maybe it can be reused for the experiments.

-  data: the cereal data set, from
   http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/DASL/Datafiles/Cereals.html
   Useful for breakfast inspiration.

-  documents: the papers to written! Currently, there is a draft with all the
   basic ideas,

-  papers: relevant papers for the project
