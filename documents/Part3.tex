\section{Algorithms}
We can now present our algorithms. Both algorithms have the same skeleton:
first, they enumerate the $k$ most promising subspaces. Then they apply the
beam search in each subspace sequentially.

\subsection{Top-k subgroups}

Here is a rough sketch of the algorithm:
\begin{verbatim}
sigma <- largest weight in the graph
cand  <- {}
While less than k cliques found
    Get partial graph G(sigma)
    Find all cliques, append them to cand
    Lower sigma
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Diverse k subgroups}

Here is a rough sketch of the algorithm:
\begin{verbatim}
sigma <- largest weight in the graph
cand  <- {}
While less than k cliques found
    Get partial graph G(sigma)
    Find all DISTINCT cliques, OVERWRITE cand 
    Lower sigma
\end{verbatim}

As it turns out, \textbf{this is exactly the complete link algorithm}. Aha!
